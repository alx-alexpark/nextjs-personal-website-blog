Welcome to my new website!

I am excited to announce the launch of my personal portfolio and blog, built using Next.js.

It's barely functional at this point, however I will continue to add more functionality in the coming weeks.

On my website, you will find a portfolio showcasing some of my past projects and experiences (WIP), as well as a blog where I will share my thoughts and insights on a variety of topics. 

I hope that my website will not only serve as a showcase for my work, but also as a platform for sharing ideas and connecting with others.

I hope you enjoy exploring my website and learning more about me. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!
