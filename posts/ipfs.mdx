As a website owner, I recently decided to put my website on InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized, peer-to-peer network for sharing and storing files. 

TBH I put my website on IPFS just because I just thought it was cool, however I have a few reasons behind the decision.

Firstly, it is resistent to censorship, so people can access the site whereever. Normally, websites are easy to censor by governments and schools. 

However, because IPFS is decentralized, there is no single point of failure or control, making it much harder for my website to be censored.

In addition to increased censorship resistance, I have also noticed improved performance and reliability since moving my website to IPFS. 

Because IPFS uses a distributed network of nodes to store and serve content, my website has been faster and more reliable than it was when it was hosted on a traditional server. 

My website gets like no visitors but better uptime is good anyway.

Finally, using IPFS makes hosting this site cost a total of $0. It costs absolutely nothing, and is extremely performant.

I hope that this influences other website owners to deploy their site on IPFS, to future proof the internet.
